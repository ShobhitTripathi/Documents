Elastic Search

Elasticsearch is a highly scalable open-source search and analytics engine built on top of Apache Lucene. It is designed to provide fast, distributed, and real-time search capabilities. Elasticsearch is commonly used for full-text search, log analytics, and as a data store for various use cases.
Here are some key features of Elasticsearch:
1. Distributed and Scalable: Elasticsearch can be easily distributed across multiple nodes to handle large amounts of data and provide high availability.
2. Near Real-time Search: It provides near real-time search capabilities, allowing you to index and search data almost instantly.
3. Full-text Search: Elasticsearch supports powerful full-text search capabilities, including fuzzy matching, stemming, and multi-language support.
4. Schema-less: You can index and search any kind of structured, unstructured, or semi-structured data without the need for a predefined schema.
5. RESTful API: Elasticsearch provides a comprehensive RESTful API for indexing, searching, and managing data.
6. Aggregations: It offers powerful aggregation capabilities to perform complex analytics, grouping, and statistical operations on data.
7. Document-oriented: Elasticsearch stores data in JSON documents, making it flexible and easy to work with.
8. Integration: It integrates well with various programming languages, frameworks, and data sources.

REDIS

Redis is an open-source, in-memory data structure store that can be used as a database, cache, and message broker. It supports various data structures such as strings, hashes, lists, sets, sorted sets, and more. Redis is known for its high performance, scalability, and simplicity.

MongoDB

MongoDB is a popular 
open-source NoSQL database that provides high performance, scalability, and flexibility for managing large volumes of unstructured data. It uses a document-oriented data model, where data is stored in flexible, 
JSON-like documents. MongoDB is known for its ease of use, automatic sharding for horizontal scalability, and support for ad-hoc queries.

Storage Engine for MongoDB
MongoDB has a pluggable storage engine architecture, which allows users to choose the storage engine that best suits their workload and performance requirements. The storage engine is responsible for managing the low-level data storage and retrieval operations in MongoDB.
Here are some key points about MongoDB storage engines:
1. WiredTiger: The default storage engine since MongoDB 3.2. It is optimized for both read and write-intensive workloads, providing a good balance of performance and storage efficiency. WiredTiger supports document-level concurrency control, compression, and advanced features like data compression and encryption.
2. In-Memory: Introduced in MongoDB 3.2, this storage engine keeps all data in RAM. It is ideal for applications requiring extremely low latency and high throughput, but with the trade-off of limited data size due to memory constraints.
3. MMAPv1: The original storage engine used in MongoDB, which has been deprecated since MongoDB 4.0. It uses memory-mapped files for data storage and provides good performance for read-heavy workloads. However, it lacks some advanced features like document-level concurrency control and compression.
To learn more about MongoDB storage engines, you can refer to the official MongoDB documentation:
1. Storage Engines: https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/core/storage-engines/
2. WiredTiger Storage Engine: https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/core/wiredtiger/
3. In-Memory Storage Engine: https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/core/inmemory/
4. MMAPv1 Storage Engine: https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/core/mmapv1/
Please note that providing actual code related to MongoDB storage engines is beyond the scope of this text-based conversation. However, the documentation links provided above contain detailed information on how to configure and work with each storage engine.
