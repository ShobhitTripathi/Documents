Alerts for micro service
To effectively monitor a microservice and ensure its reliability, it's crucial to set up alerts across all levels of the stack, covering various components. Hereâ€™s a breakdown:

1. Application/Service Level Alerts
* Health Checks
    * Application unresponsive or health check endpoint failures.
* Error Rates
    * Increase in HTTP 5xx or 4xx response rates.
    * Specific errors, e.g., NullPointerException, timeout exceptions.
* Latency
    * Average/95th percentile/99th percentile latency breaches.
* Throughput
    * Sudden drop or spike in request rate.
* Dependency Failures
    * Alerts for failures in external API calls or downstream services.
* Configuration Changes
    * Unauthorized or unexpected configuration changes.

2. Container Level Alerts
* Container Health
    * Container restarts or crashes.
* Resource Utilization
    * High CPU usage.
    * High memory usage.
* Disk Usage
    * Disk space nearing full capacity within the container.
* Image Versions
    * Running outdated or vulnerable container images.

3. Database Level Alerts
* Connection Issues
    * Connection pool saturation.
    * Failed connections to the database.
* Query Performance
    * Slow query execution (long-running queries).
    * Increase in query execution times.
* Resource Usage
    * High CPU, memory, or I/O usage on the DB server.
    * Storage nearing capacity.
* Replication/Clustering Issues
    * Replication lag in a master-slave setup.
    * Node failures in distributed databases.
* Error Logs
    * Specific database errors, e.g., deadlocks, failed transactions.

4. Cache Level Alerts
* Hit/Miss Rates
    * High cache miss rate.
* Latency
    * Slow cache read/write operations.
* Evictions
    * Sudden increase in cache evictions.
* Memory Usage
    * Cache memory utilization exceeding thresholds.
* Connection Issues
    * Unable to connect to the cache server.
* Replication
    * Alerts for replication lag or node failure in clustered caches.

5. Queue/Message Broker Level Alerts
* Message Processing
    * Messages stuck in the queue.
    * Increase in unacknowledged messages.
* Latency
    * High message processing delay.
* Throughput
    * Sudden spikes or drops in message rate.
* Connection Issues
    * Failed connections to the message broker.
* Node Health
    * Broker node crashes or going offline.
* Resource Utilization
    * High CPU or memory usage on the broker nodes.

6. Network Level Alerts
* API Gateway
    * High error rates or timeouts.
    * Sudden increase in request rates (DDoS).
* Load Balancer
    * High latency.
    * Backend instance health check failures.
* Connectivity
    * Network partitioning or connectivity loss between services.

7. Infrastructure Level Alerts
* Resource Utilization
    * High CPU, memory, or disk usage on VMs or hosts.
* Disk I/O
    * High disk I/O impacting performance.
* Node Health
    * Node/VM crashes or restarts.
* Scaling
    * Auto-scaling group failures or instances not scaling as expected.

8. Security Alerts
* Unauthorized Access
    * Failed login attempts or unauthorized API requests.
* Certificate Expiry
    * TLS certificate nearing expiration.
* Vulnerability Scans
    * Alerts for newly discovered vulnerabilities.
* Data Leakage
    * Suspicious access patterns or data exfiltration attempts.

9. Logging and Monitoring System Alerts
* Logging Volume
    * Sudden spike or drop in log volume.
* Log Error Patterns
    * Detect patterns indicating failures, e.g., repeated stack traces.
* Monitoring System Health
    * Monitoring system (e.g., Prometheus/Grafana) going down or unresponsive.

10. Custom Alerts
* Business Metrics
    * Alerts based on specific business KPIs, e.g., failed payment transactions, dropped orders.
* Custom SLAs
    * Violations of SLAs defined for service performance or availability.

Tools for Alerts
* Application Monitoring: Prometheus, Datadog, New Relic, AppDynamics.
* Log Management: ELK Stack, Splunk, Loki.
* Infrastructure Monitoring: CloudWatch (AWS), Azure Monitor, GCP Operations.
* Queue Monitoring: RabbitMQ Management Plugin, Kafka metrics.
* Database Monitoring: Percona Monitoring and Management, Cloud-specific DB monitoring.
